- As a guideline, we prefer using let over using instance variables in specs.

- To understand how let allows lazy evaluation, see the code below:
```
# this:
let(:foo) { Foo.new }

# is very nearly equivalent to this:
def foo
  @foo ||= Foo.new
end
```

- with a let, you are essentially defining a method that can be executed. 
- the code inside of the method won't be executed when the method is defined, but when it's called.
- Also, the memoization pattern ensures that whatever inside of a let block is only computed / executed once
- - when it's called again it just simply return the value stored in the @foo instance var, in the example above.
