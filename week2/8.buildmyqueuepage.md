# How to completely build my quene function
1. May tempt to treat "queue" as model - 1 queue has many queue entries/items, then queue item may asociate to videos
  - But if look at it closely, queue is just a collection of queue items
  - From MVC view, should be controller of queue items

2. In the view, iterate through the queue items and show each field as a column
3. Follow TDD to create controller, class and migration for queue items
  - For the queue items table, need two foreign keys: user id and video id
4. Create some queue items in the console to test
5. Write the interfaces we wish to have for the queue items, e.g. `queue_item.video_title`
6. User `delegate` method: 
    - `delegate :category, to: :video` equals to:
    ```
    def category
      video.category
    end
    ```
    When you call cateogry, it delegate to the video associated with it
7. We need to add the position for the queue items
  - count the current user's queue items first, then plus 1
